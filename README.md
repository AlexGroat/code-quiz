# **Code Quiz** #

# *Description* #

In this project I have designed a quiz application using HTML, CSS and Javascript. This project uses Javascript to ask the user questions
about coding and collects the user input and displayus it in a highscores page. It also punishes the user for a wrong answer
by subtracting from the score and time.
